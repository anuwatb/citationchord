Around 2016, I developed a webpage using PHP code retrieving data from a database to demonstrate relationships between authors from an institute and subject areas of journals citing them. See a gist at https://gist.github.com/anuwatb/fde0f206d1bc85e888182f40af3cb06a (The gist shows only the code used to create the diagram, not the whole page. It used Javascript code reading data from a CSV file.)

Now, I converted the PHP code to Javascript code reading data from a CSV file and deleted some parts. There may be someone who finds it useful.
